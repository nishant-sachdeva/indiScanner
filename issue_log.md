Issues faced and their solutions : 

1. Installation of react-native :
	Installing and starting the dev environment requires a lot of work apparently 

	Android studio, node, java etc needs to be installed. It also demands some "workflow" installation, but since it's only precautional, I am leaving it be

	At this moment, installing and getting android studio to work is the biggest headache. First of all, loads of internet requirements.

	Second, virtualisation requirements. I am currently installing virtualisation requirements, and I need to get my system to restart. But since that would interrupt the Android Studio Download, I am having to wait for now.
